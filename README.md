# birthday_letter ðŸŽ‚
Simple birthday template that utilizes [Typed.js](https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/) to create an interactive birthday letter. Feel free to customize it to your likings and add images or gifs that make your friend laugh or smile. 
This is a very light project, demonstrating how small projects like these can make your friend's birthday a little bit better :)

## Deployment
If you want to send this over to a friend. I would reccomend deploying using [Surge](https://surge.sh/). It is amazingly fast way to deploy static sites. Just run the following commands:
```
npm install --global surge
surge
```
A live demo of how the letter looks like can be seen [here](https://quickest-dog.surge.sh/)!
